My last attempt is probably around 2011. I hope this one will last longer! So what to expect from this blog?</p>

<h2 id="programmingandsoftwarearchitecture">Programming and software architecture</h2>

<p>I'm currently the CTO at <a href='http://musescore.com/' >MuseScore</a>. Primarly, MuseScore is a desktop application written in C++/Qt. I'm also in charge of the development of the MuseScore mobile apps for both iOS and Android. So I will probably write about Qt, QML, C++ and mobile development.</p>

<p>MuseScore is also two websites <a href='http://musescore.org/' >http://musescore.org</a> and <a href='http://musescore.com/' >http://musescore.com</a>. I'm not the webmaster of these two websites, but I did work on the development of both. The two websites are made with <a href='http://drupal.org/' >Drupal</a> and PHP. In particular, I worked on the <a href='http://developers.musescore.com/' >MuseScore.com API</a> and on the overall architecture of MuseScore.com running on AWS. So you might expect post about Drupal, PHP, Javascript, Java and AWS services.</p>

<p>I'm learning Python which is becoming my scripting language of choice. I also like to dabble in Node.js. And I'm planning to play with Go in the coming months.</p>

<h3 id="musicandmusicnotation">Music and Music Notation</h3>

<p>I'm a drummer and music lover. MuseScore is all about music notation. Expect some posts about music in general, music notation in particular, and maybe drumming.</p>

<h3 id="entrepeneurship">Entrepeneurship</h3>

<p>MuseScore is my first entrepeunarial endeavior. Putting in place a business model around a B2C free and open source software is challenging. I might post about this challenge and about the sheet music and music education market in general.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/first-post-what-to-expect/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">ff607005-dd48-47c6-ae6b-7da805d0a670</guid><category><![CDATA[blog]]></category><category><![CDATA[about]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[lasconic]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2014 10:04:38 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
