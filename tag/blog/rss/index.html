My last attempt was probably around 2011. I hope this one will last longer! So what to expect from this blog?

<h2 id="programmingandsoftwarearchitecture">Programming and software architecture</h2>

<p>I'm currently the CTO at <a href="http://musescore.com/">MuseScore</a>. Primarly, MuseScore is a desktop application written in C++/Qt. I'm also in charge of the development of the MuseScore mobile apps for both iOS and Android. So I will probably write about Qt, QML, C++ and mobile development.</p>

<p>MuseScore is also two websites <a href="http://musescore.org/">http://musescore.org</a> and <a href="http://musescore.com/">http://musescore.com</a>. I'm not the webmaster of these two websites, but I did work on the development of both. The two websites are made with <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and PHP. In particular, I worked on the <a href="http://developers.musescore.com/">MuseScore.com API</a> and on the overall architecture of MuseScore.com running on AWS. So you might expect post about Drupal, PHP, Javascript, Java and AWS services.</p>

<p>I'm learning Python which is becoming my scripting language of choice. I also like to dabble in Node.js. And I'm planning to play with Go in the coming months.</p>

<h3 id="musicandmusicnotation">Music and Music Notation</h3>

<p>I'm a drummer and music lover. MuseScore is all about music notation. Expect some posts about music in general, music notation in particular, and maybe drumming.</p>

<h3 id="entrepeneurship">Entrepeneurship</h3>

<p>MuseScore is my first entrepeunarial endeavior. Putting in place a business model around a B2C free and open source software is challenging. I might post about this challenge and about the sheet music and music education market in general.</p>

<h3 id="englishmainly">English mainly</h3>

<p>Maybe you didn't figure it out yet but my mother tongue is French. I'm more confortable with English for technical topics, so I will mainly blog in English.</p>

<p>Happy reading!</p>]]&gt;</description><link/>http://127.0.0.1:2368/first-post-what-to-expect/<guid ispermalink="false">ff607005-dd48-47c6-ae6b-7da805d0a670</guid><category/><category/><creator/><pubdate>Wed, 03 Sep 2014 10:04:38 GMT</pubdate></item></channel></rss>
